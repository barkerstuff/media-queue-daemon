# This script is intended to just gather links that are send to it.
# It's usefor stuff such as newsboat which doesn't collate the URLs into a long string, but rather just hammers the media player each time
#   i.e. opening 100 instances of mpv if 100 videos are selected

# Here's how it works:
# 1) Runs as a daemon
# 2) Listens for a while and collates the standard input
# 3) If no output for a few seconds, processes the data, sorts as best it can and then exports to mpv
# There is mpv_queue_client.py, which is ideal for calling to send stuff to the daemon
#  (using pipes with netcat can also work, but flaky with the launch strings in newsboat)

# ToDo
# - Investigate why some youtube videos do not seem to get a regexp match for the published date.  Perhaps they don't have the metatag?
# - Remove some of those globals
